I developed the signature, a model to mine recurring purchase behavior of retail customers.

The signature is at the intersection of the pattern mining and sequence segmentation fields.

I developed different algorithms mining different type of signatures in Java.
I also ran an analysis of a large real world retail dataset using Spark.

You can test these algorithms on this <a target="_blank" href="http://people.irisa.fr/Thomas.Guyet/demo_signatures/signatures.php">webpage</a>.

I also developed different visualizations of signatures using D3.js, Vega and matplotlib.
I also performed many experiments and analyses using Python and its data science stack (Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
